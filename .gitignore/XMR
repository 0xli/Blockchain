# Run the Monero daemon. It will sync with the network and display the message "You are now synchronized with the network. You may now start monero-wallet-cli" when it is completely up to date with the network
# LINUX/MAC:
./monerod
# The job of the Monero daemon is to monitor the network for new transactions. You now need to open a new terminal window and run the Monero command line wallet, which will communicate with the Monero daemon that you've just stared.
# LINUX/MAC:
./monero-wallet-cli

2. compile mine software

https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak
git clone https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak.git
# Ubuntu / Debian
    sudo apt install libmicrohttpd-dev libssl-dev cmake build-essential libhwloc-dev
    git clone https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak.git
    mkdir xmr-stak/build
    cd xmr-stak/build
    #cmake ..
    cmake -DCUDA_ENABLE=OFF -DOpenCL_ENABLE=OFF ..
    make install

3. Run mine software
It will ask you to choose http port, currency and pool ip/port with your wallet address 
./xmr-stak
